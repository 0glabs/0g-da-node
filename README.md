# 0G Data Availability Node

## Overview

0G DA is a modular data availability layer designed for high-performance and high-throughput chains and rollups, particularly in AI and gaming. 


## Architecture

0G DA consists of the following modules:

1. Data Availability Nodes and Signers on the DA network
2. Data Availability Clients and Encoders on the rollup/appchain side for data dispersion

Across the two sets of nodes, 0G DA supports the following features:

- **Erasure Coding**: Data is split into chunks and distributed across Storage Nodes.
- **KZG Commitments**: Uses the AMT protocol to reduce overhead when verifying KZG commitments.
- **Verifiable Random Function (VRF)**: Ensures unpredictable and verifiable selection of DA Nodes for availability sampling.
- **Quorum-based and Sampling-basedVerification**: Small groups of DA nodes work together to check and efficiently verify stored data.
- **Separate Validator Network**: Validators finalize proofs submitted by DA nodes.
